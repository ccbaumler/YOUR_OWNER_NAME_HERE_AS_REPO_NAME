## 📖 Theory: Issues with Issues

GitHub issues are the communication platform between maintainers, contributors, and users of a repository. Issues are a great place to document software bugs, documentation errors, or request features. In most repositories, this is all the issue tracker is used for and most issues are closed upon completion.

However, the issue tracker's tagging and search functions are extremely powerful (e.g. issue state, label, author, time, reactions, and so on). My lab, the Data Intensive Biology lab, has a unique take on GitHub issues because of these features. We use our repository issues as a home for novel ideas, scripts, conversations, and documentation as much as tracking true software issues. [Here is our flagship lab software's repository with over 700 issues, for example](https://github.com/sourmash-bio/sourmash/).
